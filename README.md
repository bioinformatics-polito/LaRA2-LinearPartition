# LaRA2-LinearPartition: Fork of LinearPartition used in LaRA2.
This is a fork of the [LinearPartition](https://github.com/LinearFold/LinearPartition) project.

In this fork LinearPartition is modified to be used inside the LaRA2 project.

LaRA2 requires the calculation of the bppm and the energy for a given sequence. To avoid using system calls to the LinearPartition 
binary, the objective is to adapt LinearPartition so that LaRA2 can call some c++ function directly.

In particular, for the branch **asSubmodule**: Modifications required to use LinearPartition as a submodule of another tool. In this case of LaRA2.
    
- Use of namespace linearp to avoid clashing with Vienna definitions

- Removed main (therefore LinearPartition can not be used as standalone executable in this branch)

- Allow for the usage of LinearPartition-V or LinearPartition-C from LaRA. For this, a new input parameter `useVienna` has been added, together with two template parameters ` <typename pf_type, typename value_type>`. Some other small modifications were required as converting some functions to members of the `BeamCKYParser` class. The preprocesor selector `lpv` has been removed.

- Make the members holding the bppm, energy and log Partition Coefficient public so they can be accessed from LaRA

- Small modifications ( castings, type changes, unused params ) to avoid warnings during compilation.

## Dependencies
gcc 4.8.5 or above; 
python2.7
LaTex for drawing circular plot
numpy, pandas, seaborn and matplotlib for drawing heatmap plot

## To Compile
```
make
```

## To Run
LinearPartition can be run with:
```
echo SEQUENCE | ./linearpartition [OPTIONS]

OR

cat SEQ_OR_FASTA_FILE | ./linearpartition [OPTIONS]
```
Both FASTA format and pure-sequence format are supported for input.

OPTIONS:
```
-b BEAM_SIZE
```
The beam size (default 100). Use 0 for infinite beam.
```
-V
```
Switches LinearPartition-C (by default) to LinearPartition-V.
```
--verbose
```
Prints out beamsize, Log Partition Coefficient or free energy of ensemble (-V mode) and runtime information. (default False)
```
--sharpturn
```
Enable sharpturn. (default False)
```
-o FILE_NAME
```
Outputs base pairing probability matrix to a file with user specified name. (default False)
```
-r FILE_NAME
```
Output base pairing probability matrix to a file with user specified name (overwrite if the file exists). (default False)
```
--prefix PREFIX_NAME
```
Outputs base pairing probability matrices to files with user specified prefix. (default False)
```
-p
```
Partition function calculation only. (default False)
```
-c CUTOFF
```
Only output base pair probability larger than user specified threshold between 0 and 1. (DEFAULT=0.0)
```

--dumpforest
```
dump forest (all nodes with inside [and outside] log partition functions but no hyperedges) for downstream tasks such as sampling and accessibility (DEFAULT=None)

```
--mea or -M
```
get MEA structure, (DEFAULT=FALSE)

```
--gamma
```
set MEA gamma, (DEFAULT=3.0)

```
--bpseq
```
output MEA structure(s) in bpseq format instead of dot-bracket format

```
--mea_prefix
```
output MEA structure(s) to file(s) with user specified prefix name

```
--threshknot or -T
```
get ThreshKnot structure, (DEFAULT=FALSE)

```
--threshold
```
set ThreshKnot threshknot, (DEFAULT=0.3)

```
--threshknot_prefix
```
output ThreshKnot structure(s) to file(s) with user specified prefix name (default False)

```
--shape <filename>
```
use SHAPE reactivity data (for -V mode only)  
Please refer to this link for the SHAPE data format:
https://rna.urmc.rochester.edu/Text/File_Formats.html#SHAPE


## To Visualize 
LinearPartition provides two ways to visualize base pairing probabilities, circular plot and heatmap plot.

In a circular plot, the darkness of each arc represents the probability of each base pair (see an example below). 
To draw a circular plot, run command:  
```
cat TARGET_FILE | ./draw_bpp_plot BASE_PAIRING_PROBABILITY_FILE
```
TARGET_FILE contains one sequence and its structure; see "ecoli_tRNA" file as an example.
BASE_PAIRING_PROBABILITY_FILE can be a probability file generated by LinearPartition, or a file with the same format; see "ecoli_tRNA_bpp" as an example.

To draw a heatmap plot, run command:  
```
cat BASE_PAIRING_PROBABILITY_FILE | ./draw_heatmap SEQUENCE_LENGTH
```
SEQUENCE_LENGTH is the length of the sequence.

## Example: Run Predict
```
